## Overview 
  
  The project is in support of Dana, who has a keen interest for UFOs, and wants to have a web-based search capability for a database on UFO sighting information. Dana is from Oregon and her hometown has a history of UFO sightings. To complete the project, Javascript and HTML are utilized to gather and display UFO-related data using filters, to generate a web site with an interactive user dashboard. 

   ### Purpose
   
   To create a user interactive webpage that allows users to parse data of recorded UFO sightings as an analysis by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Table filters are are used for the date, city, state, country, and shape. And, to build a filtering engine with: 1) a webpage that will allow users to view the data (using HTML), and 2) a dynamic table that will present the information (using JavaScript).

  
   The deliverables are:  
   
   - Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
   - Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (This README.md report file)
  
   
  
   ### Resources
  * Data/content sources: data.js file 
  * Software: Windows10, VS Code 1.49.1, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap

 * **Example of the Instructions:**   
   *Note: Be sure to use small-case letters within the search filter windows, as the text for information is case sensitive.*

## Summary
  
  ### Drawback of the Design 
   **Adding search criteria**:  --  The current method coding being used is relatively ridgid, and adding additional and new search criteria as filters, and as columns, could mean rewriting most of the code. 


.
  
  ### Recommendations for further development

   1. **Additional user interactiviy features:**  --  User interaction features that could be considered and added include:
    - An interactive geograpy map, showing all locations, with a touch-screen map with filter choice for dates and shapes. The geo map would improve efficiency by quickly showing three of the five search filter criteria for City, State and Country, and then allowing the user to quickly select date and shape. The new graphic image would have the impact of a strong visual for single and multiple users. 
  
   2. **Data set size:**  --  From a Googlesearch, there are several serious UFO sighting tracking efforts on-going with passionate people that recording and searching for this type of information. Increasing the data set, and with using web scraping, the data set avaialble for our search engine could be greatly improved for the amount and historical results available. The potential sites available to source additional data could include these: NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER http://www.ufocenter.com/ ,  National UFO Research Center http://www.nuforc.org/ , and at Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings , and ArcGIS Online https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ddda71d5211f47e782b12f3f8d06246e .
