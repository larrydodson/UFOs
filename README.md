## Overview 
  
  In support of Dana, who is from Oregon and has a keen interest of UFOs, and where her hometown has a history of UFO sitings. Using Javascript and HTML to gather and display UFO-related data using filters, to generate a web site with an interactive dashboard. 

   ### Purpose
   
   To create a user interactive webpage that allows users to parse data of recorded UFO sightings as an analysis by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Table filters are are used for the date, city, state, country, and shape. to build an filtering engine with: 1) a webpage that will allow users to view the data (using HTML), and 2) a dynamic table that will present the information (using JavaScript).

  
   The deliverables are:  
   
   - Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
   - Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (This README.md file)
  
   
  
   ### Resources
  * Data/content sources: data.js file 
  * Software: Windows10, VS Code 1.49.1, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap

## Results
  
  ###  -- The web app is deployed here (using GitHub Pages):  https://larrydodson.github.io/UFO_Finder/

## Summary
  
  ### Drawback(s) 
  (describe one drawback of this new design)
  
  
  .
  
  ### Recommendations 
  (two of them for further development)



rough notes:
 - interaction with the time-series
the different means of filtering
Bad: loose coordination between map and subplots
enabled the user to inspect time intervals of interest, and then select time intervals to then update the map (beit the choropleth or reports).
Clicking on bars in the Shape and Duration subplots would have made an effective mechanism to filter reports on the map.
The scatterplot is cluttered enough to begin with, and so this means of filtering via the other subplots would have been a nice way to interact with the scatterplot.
Moreover, it would be nice to have some way of showing what states are selected on the map, rather than just the legend on the upper right.
